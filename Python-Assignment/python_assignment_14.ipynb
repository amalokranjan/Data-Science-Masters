    "### Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "    Multithreading in Python is a way of executing multiple threads(smaller units of a process) simultaneously in a single process to improve the overall performance of the application.\n",
    "    It is used for parallelism and concurrency. It allows the execution of multiple threads simultaneously in a single process, allowing faster and more efficient of a program.\n",

    "### Q2. Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions:\n",
    "    The threading module is used to create, manage and synchronize threads in a multi-threaded program. It allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single process, enabling a programm to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, thus improving the program's efficiency and responsiveness.\n",
    "    1. activeCount(): It is used to count the number of active threads in the current thread's processing unit.\n",
    "    2. currentThread(): It is used to return the current thread object that is running the caller code.\n",
    "    3. enumerate() : It is used to iterate over a sequence(such as a list or tuple) and keep track of the index of the current item being processed. It returns an iterator that generates pairs of the form(index, item) where index is the index of the item in the sequence and item is the actual item."

    "    2. start(): start() function is used to start a new thread. This function causes the 'run()' method of the thread to be executed in s seperate thread of control.\n",
    "    3. join(): It is used to wait for a thread to finish its execution before continuing with the main program.\n",
    "    4. isAlive(): It is used to check whether a thread is still active or not. It returns 'True' if the thread is still running, and 'False' otherwise."
