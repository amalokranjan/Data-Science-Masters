    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "    MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible and scalable JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed for high scalability, performance, and availability, and it has become a popular choice for modern applications that require flexible and dynamic data models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Non-relational database, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that store data in a non-tabular format. They do not rely on a fixed schema and can handle a variety of data types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. They are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data with ease. They are often used in big data applications, where data is unstructured or semi-structured, and traditional SQL databases may not be suitable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured or semi-structured, and the schema may change frequently. It is also suitable for applications that require high scalability and performance, as it can handle large amounts of data with ease and scale horizontally across multiple servers. Additionally, it is well-suited for real-time applications that require high availability that require strict data consistency and integrity, as they provide strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "    MongoDB is a NoSQL document-oriented database system that stores data in a JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "    1. Flexible data model: MongoDB's document-based data model provides a flexible schema that can handle different types and structure of data. It allows the storage of complex data types such as arrays, nested documents, and geospatial data.\n",
    "    2. Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable, both horizontally and vertically. It can easily handle large volumes of data and high-traffic applications by adding more nodes to a cluster or increasing resources on a singly node.\n",
    "    3. High performance: MongoDB's architecture is designed for high performance, with features like memory-mapped files and automatic sharding. It also has a rich query language and indexing support to optimize performance.\n",
    "    4. Replication and High Availability: MongoDB supports automatic replication and failover, which ensures that data is always available even in case of hardware failures or network issues.\n",
    "    5. Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language supports a wide range of queries, including ad-hoc queries, aggregation, and geospatial queries. It also supports full-text search and graph processing.\n",
    "    6. Document-based Transactions: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, which allow developers to perform complex operations across multiple documents in a single transaction."
