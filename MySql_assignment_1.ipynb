    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "    A database is a collection of organized data that is stored and accessed electronically. It is used to store and manage data efficiently so that it can be easily accessed, modified, and updated as per the requirements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Data model: SQL databases use a relational data model, while NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-family models.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Query language: SQL databases use SQL language to interact with the data, while NoSQL databases use different query languages use different query languages, such as MongoDB's query lanuguage, Cassandra Query Language(CQL), or Couchbase Query Language(N1QL).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means they can handle increased load by upgrading the hardware, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means they can handle increased load by adding more servers or nodes ot the cluster.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Data consistency: SQL databases prioritize consistency over availability, while NoSQL databases prioritize availability over consistency."

    "    \n",
    "    DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing object within a database. For example, to add a new column \"salary\" to the \"employees\" table created earlier, the following command can be used:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN salary INT;\n",
    "    \n",
